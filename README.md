## Usage

1. In the GitHub repository, go to the top right corner and click on `Settings`

2. On the sidebar, find `Secrets and variables`, click to expand and select `Actions`, then click `New repository secret`
    
3. Then create a `Secret` named `ACCOUNTS_JSON`, set its value as the account and password string in JSON format, as follows:  

``` json
[  
  { "username": "qishihuang", "password": "zhanghao", "panelnum": "3" },  
  { "username": "zhaogao", "password": "daqinzhonggong", "panelnum": "1" },  
  { "username": "heiheihei", "password": "shaibopengke", "panelnum": "2" }  
]
```

> The `panelnum` parameter is the panel number, which is the `*` value in the `panel*.serv00.com` from the registration email you received.

Although serv00 has a 10-year usage period, it cannot clear logs generated by Apache and other services. Under capacity constraints, high-traffic services that generate large logs and high-frequency tasks are not recommended.
